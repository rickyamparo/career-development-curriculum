# Documentation Guidelines for Cold Outreach I Deliverable:

* Name of contact
  * "The mentor (or alum) I contacted is Tommasina Miller"

* Date of Initial contact
  * "August 27th 2017"

* Outcome (i.e., did you get a response? If not, what is your follow-up plan? Did you meet? When? What was the result?)

  *  "At first we had to reschedule because she was moving. We were finally able to meet each other on September 8th. We met at turing and discussed her passion for creating diversity groups. Through our conversation I learned about the work that she was doing as well as the push back that she's received. 

* How do you feel like this relationship will benefit you in your longterm professional development? 

This relationship will help me becuase Tommasina has invited to a few meetups. Having a person specifically invite me to a meetup will help me take the leap and go to one.
